Given the type of food, quantity (no. of plates) and the distance in kms from the restaurant to the delivery point, implement a program to calculate the final bill amount to be paid by a customer.
The below information must be used to check the validity of the data provided by the customer: 
Type of food must be 'V' for vegetarian and 'N' for non-vegetarian.
Distance in kms must be greater than 0.
Quantity ordered should be minimum 1.
If any of the input is invalid, the bill amount should be displayed as -1.

6. Implement a program to calculate the product of three positive integer values. However, if one of the integers is 7, consider only the values to the right of 7 for calculation. If 7 is the last integer, then display -1.
Note: Only one of the three values can be 7.

7. The Metro Bank provides various types of loans such as car loans, business loans and house loans to its account holders, i.e., customers.

Implement a program to determine the eligible loan amount and the EMI that the bank can provide to its customers based on their salary and the loan type they expect to avail.

The values required for determining the eligible loan amount and the EMI are:
- account number of the customer
- account balance of the customer
- salary of the customer
- loan type 
- expected loan amount
- expected no. of EMIs
- The following validations should be performed:
- The account number should be of 4 digits and its first digit should be 1
- The customer should have a minimum balance of $1000 in the account
Display appropriate error messages if the validations fail.

If the validations pass, determine whether the bank would provide the loan or not. 

The bank would provide the loan, only if the loan amount and the number of EMIs expected by the customer is less than or equal to the loan amount and the number of EMIs decided by the bank respectively. The bank decides the eligible loan amount and the number of EMIs based on the below table.
